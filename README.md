## Course description
A.B.T(abstract data types). Complexity of algorithms, performance analysis of algorithms. Sort to RAM and HD. Trees, binary search trees. 
Applications, Huffman codes, heaps. Graphs, problems with graphs and applications (minimum spanning tree, shortest path). 
Searching in the memory and the disk, serial and indexed search, search performance analysis. Hierarchical search with trees, trees and memory (binarysearchtrees, AVLtrees, optimaltrees, splaytrees), performance analysis. 
Multi-way search memory (multi-way search trees, B-trees, B + -trees). 
Trees, digital search trees, texttrees, Patricia trees, Lempel-Ziv coding. 
Uncategorized search, hashing in the memory, collision resolution method, open addressing, separatechaining, search complexity analysis. Disk hashing (dynamic hashing, extendible hashing, linearhashing), search performance analysis.
